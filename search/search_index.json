What evidence would be required to demonstrate that hydrogen qualifies as renewable?","text":"<p>Reply: The RED does not include a definition of renewable hydrogen. Instead, the RED includes a definition of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO), which covers hydrogen produced via electrolysis from renewable electricity as well as its derivatives. The term renewable hydrogen is often used as a simplification for hydrogen that qualifies as a RFNBO under the RED [^3]. To count as an RFNBO, hydrogen is required to 1) fulfil the definition of an RFNBO as set out in Article 2(36) of RED, 2) comply with the rules set out in Article 27(6) of the RED for the sourcing of renewable electricity 3) achieve 70% emissions savings and (4) be traced through the supply chain in line with the rules set out in Article 30(1) and (2) RED. In this context the hydrogen delegated acts set out detailed rules for sourcing of renewable electricity that is used for the production of RFNBOs and for determining the GHG emission intensity (GHG methodology)[^4].</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q2","title":"2. For what purposes do the rules on renewable hydrogen set out in RED apply?","text":"<p>Reply: The rules have to be met to count renewable hydrogen towards the targets set out in the RED. Complying with the rules is not a prerequisite for importing hydrogen or for placing hydrogen on the EU market but may be a prerequisite for receiving public support.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q3","title":"3. Are the RFNBO delegated act and the GHG methodology interlinked?","text":"<p>Reply: The RFNBO delegated act complements the RED by setting out detailed rules on how fuel producers can source electricity that counts as fully renewable. The RED itself already includes a rule that allows sourcing electricity that counts as partially renewable (average share of renewable electricity in the country in the year n-2). The GHG methodology includes a life-cycle approach to determine the greenhouse gas emission intensity of RFNBOs (and recycled carbon fuels \u201cRCF\u201d). This approach distinguishes between electricity that counts as fully renewable and electricity that counts as partially renewable. In addition, the methodology includes a formula that allows deriving the amount of RFNBOs and RCF that is produced as this is required to derive the emission intensity. The delegated acts are therefore closely interlinked.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q4","title":"4. What is the geographic scope of the hydrogen delegated acts?","text":"<p>Reply: The hydrogen delegated acts apply to hydrogen consumed in the EU, regardless of whether the hydrogen is produced inside or outside the territory of the Union. However, the application of the rules is limited to the purposes described under question 2. Accordingly, they do not set out binding rules for hydrogen production in third countries.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q5","title":"5. What means do fuel producers have to demonstrate that they comply with the criteria?","text":"<p>Reply: For certification of renewable hydrogen, producers can rely on a well-established system of certification by third parties, so-called voluntary schemes[^5]. These are international companies with experience of more than a decade in certifying biofuels, biomass and other products worldwide. The Commission has been empowered to recognise voluntary and national schemes for certifying renewable hydrogen. The Member States are required to accept evidence from schemes that have been recognised by the Commission.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q6","title":"6. How does the recognition process for voluntary certification schemes work?","text":"<p>Reply: Voluntary schemes may submit applications for recognition to the Commission[^6]. Before recognition, the schemes undergo a thorough assessment. Schemes meeting all criteria are recognised by the Commission via Commission Implementing Decisions. More details can be found on a dedicated &lt;u1. website&lt;/u1. .</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q7","title":"7. How can hydrogen producers get certified?","text":"<p>Reply: Hydrogen producers have the option to either contact a voluntary scheme or to approach a national scheme set up by the EU Member States to get certified.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q8","title":"8. May voluntary schemes apply further sustainability criteria (e.g. water input, resource efficiency etc.) than those set out under the RED and the delegated acts?","text":"<p>Reply: Voluntary schemes are required to apply the criteria and certification rules set out in EU legislation. They may, however, go beyond these criteria on a voluntary basis provided compliance with the mandatory rules is still ensured.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q9","title":"9. When can fuel producers start to certify renewable hydrogen under voluntary schemes? Is it possible to be certified before fuel production has started?","text":"<p>Reply: Economic operators are required to successfully pass an initial audit before allowing them to participate in a voluntary scheme. The initial audit must always be on-site and must provide reasonable assurance on the effectiveness of its internal processes. This means that economic operators cannot make claims about the sustainability characteristics of individual consignments of RFNBOs under a voluntary scheme before the construction of the plant has been finalised and the plant is fully functioning. However, voluntary schemes are allowed to conduct document-based pre-audits assessing whether a project is designed in a way that should normally allow to pass the audit at a later stage. Such evidence may facilitate obtaining financing of projects. However, it must be considered that the official audits must be based on actual data from the facility.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q10","title":"10. The RFNBO delegated act and the GHG methodology use the term renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin while the revised RED refers to renewable fuels of non-biological origin. Does this mean that the voluntary schemes should apply the methodologies set out in the delegated acts only to fuels consumed in the transport sector?","text":"<p>Reply: The revision on the RED increased the scope of the RFNBO definition to cover other sectors than transport. Accordingly, the Commission Decisions recognising the voluntary schemes will also apply the new terminology. The delegated acts will eventually be aligned with the new terminology. In the meantime, voluntary schemes that aim to cover other sectors than transport should apply the methodologies set out in the legislation that is in force for the certification of all RFNBOs, independently of the sectors where they are consumed.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#detailed-questions-rfnbo-delegated-act","title":"Detailed questions: RFNBO Delegated Act","text":""},{"location":"faq/#scope","title":"Scope","text":""},{"location":"faq/#Q11","title":"11.  Must all energy consumption used by a hydrogen production facility be of renewable origin to produce RFNBOs?","text":"<p>Reply: No, not necessarily. Electricity or other forms of energy that are used for other purposes (lighting, safety, balance of system) but do not add to the heating value of the output do not need to be renewable. However, the CO2 content of this energy source should be taken into account to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions savings achieved by the RFNBO.

How should the RES-E share in bidding zones be calculated (Article 4(1) of the RFNBO delegated act)?","text":"<p>Reply: The average share of renewable electricity shall be determined by dividing the gross final consumption of electricity from renewable sources in the bidding zone, calculated by analogy to the rules set out in Article 7(2) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, by the gross electricity production from all energy sources as defined in Annex B to Regulation (EC) 1099/2008, except from water previously pumped uphill (excluded from both the numerator and the denominator), plus imports minus exports of electricity to the bidding zone. Imports and exports are not considered in the numerator. Where bidding zones are identical to countries, the latest data on the RES-E that has been published by Eurostat are to be used for EU Member States and the latest data on the share of renewable electricity that has been published by the IEA for third countries. When IEA data is not available, data from the nation statistical institutes may be used. Where bidding zones are not identical to countries, data from official national statistics that have been derived in line with the methodology applied for determining the RES-E share in the SHARES tool have to be used [^7].</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q16","title":"16. Under which scenario is a bidding zone, for which it has been established that the share of renewable electricity is 90% or more, no longer considered as having this status?","text":"<p>Reply: A bidding zone is no longer considered under Article 4(1) of the RFNBO delegated act to have a share of renewable electricity higher than 90% if the actual share drops below 90% for more than 5 consecutive years.

What are the minimum requirements for \u201crenewable PPAs\u201d?","text":"<p>Reply: The requirements for renewable PPAs stem from the definition set out in the RED itself and the RFNBO delegated act. In the RED, a renewable PPA is defined as a contract under which a natural or legal person agrees to purchase renewable electricity directly from an electricity producer. The delegated act allows fuel producers to conclude one or more renewable power purchase agreements directly, or via intermediaries. The renewable PPAs need to clearly identify the installations that produce the amount of renewable electricity that is used to produce the renewable hydrogen. Furthermore, the hydrogen producer can only claim the production of RFNBOs based on a renewable PPA if the electricity supplied under the</p> <p>contract has effectively been produced. Intermediaries referred to in the RFNBO delegated act may be involved by various means and for various purposes, including as a contracting party. For example, intermediaries can represent the electricity producers, but it is important that a direct relationship between the electricity producer and the hydrogen producer is maintained. In addition, the requirements on cancelling Guarantees of Origin \u201cGOs\u201d as described under question 20, the requirements set out in Article 5 of the RFNBO delegated act, as well as the requirements set out in Article 19 RED (referred to in recital 15 of the RFNBO DA), have to be met.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q20","title":"20. Several provisions in the RFNBO delegated act require concluding renewables PPAs with economic operators producing renewable electricity. What requirements would apply for GOs in this context?","text":"<p>Reply: The GOs for the PPA need to comply with the general requirements in Article 19 of RED and furthermore carry the same attributes as the physical installation producing the electricity. This includes e.g. the location of the installation, the age of the installation, and the time of the production. The associated GOs need to be cancelled before the expiry of the validity period and the volume cancelled shall correspond to that claimed under the PPA. The RES-e producer is not allowed to sell or transfer the associated GOs to any other entity than the operator of the electrolyser under the PPA. To enforce this, the Member State may decide to immediately cancel the associated electricity GOs.

What could be considered as operating aid or investment aid referred to in Article 5(b) of the RFNBO delegated act?","text":"<p>Reply: Operating aid or investment aid referred to in Article 5(b) could be considered to include any payments received from public authorities for the construction of the installations generating renewable electricity and any benefits received from public authorities for the production of renewable electricity, including feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums, reductions applying for the production, contracts for difference or any direct payments linked to the production of renewable electricity. Operating aid or investment aid does not include obligations or restrictions placed on energy consumers, producers or suppliers such as renewable energy obligations. Article 5(b) also sets out that support received by installations before their repowering, financial support for land or for grid connections, support that does not constitute net support and incentives provided via the renewable PPA are not considered. Whether e.g., a contract for difference constitutes net support should be assessed ex-ante and verified ex-post. For the ex-ante assessment, fuel producers should demonstrate based on the terms of the contract for difference that the contract is unlikely to result in net support for the contracted installation generating renewable electricity. In the ex-post verification, fuel producers should demonstrate that the contracted installations generating renewable electricity did not receive net support.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q22","title":"22. How could the definition of \u2018come into operation\u2019 set out in Article 2(5) be understood? First day of commercial delivery of even an uncomplete installation?","text":"<p>Reply: The RFNBO delegated act defines \u2018come into operation\u2019 as starting production of renewable fuels of non-biological origin or renewable electricity for the first time. Starting production should be considered to include any form of commercial production of hydrogen, derivate or renewable electricity that is intended to be used or sold and goes beyond a pure testing of the installation. If the installation is taken into operation step by step (part of the capacity at date 1 and other part(s) of the capacity at (a) later date(s)), then the definition of coming into operation would refer to the first date. This applies to installations producing renewable electricity as well as to installations producing RFNBOs. For installations producing RFNBOs, the conditions for adding additional capacity in Articles 3(b) and 5(a), 3<sup>rd</sup> subparagraph, of the RFNBO delegated act shall be complied with in order to consider the different capacity parts as one installation.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#temporal-and-geographic-correlation","title":"Temporal and geographic correlation","text":""},{"location":"faq/#Q23","title":"23.

May fuel producers source renewable electricity via different options (counting as partially renewable and counting as fully renewable)?","text":"<p>Reply: The RED sets out two main pathways to produce RFNBOs: The first approach, set out in the fourth subparagraph of Article 27(3), determines the share of renewable hydrogen based on the share of renewable electricity in the country of production in the year n-2. The second approach set out in the fifth and sixth subparagraphs of Article 27(3), which is further detailed in the RFNBO delegated act, allows the production of fully renewable hydrogen via several sub-options. Fuel producers may combine the pathways and options to source renewable electricity provided the way the electricity is sourced is fully documented in line with the requirements set out in Article 8 of the RFNBO delegated act. This applies also for electricity sourced during the same time interval. For each way of sourcing electricity, the dedicated rules apply. If for instance an electrolyser is fed with 50% electricity that counts as fully renewable and 50% electricity that is only 40% renewable, 70% of the total hydrogen produced will be renewable.

This will be the case in particular when hourly temporal correlation is applied. Given that the requirement for hourly correlation applies only as from 2030, monthly correlation may be sufficient in many cases unless compliance options, which require checking hourly data, are applied (e.g. sourcing of electricity from an interconnected bidding zone, curtailment).

Which requirements on electricity GOs would apply when the RFNBO delegated act does not require the conclusion of a renewables PPA (e.g. areas with more than 90% RES in the electricity mix)","text":"<p>Reply: According to recital 15 of the RFNBO delegated act, Article 19 of RED obliges Member States to ensure that the same unit of energy from renewable sources is taken into account only once. Therefore, if RES GOs have been issued for the electricity used to produce the hydrogen, then these GOs need to be cancelled. The cancellation of the respective GOs can be done e.g. by the competent body designated by the Member States or by the producer of the hydrogen.

What are examples for elastic and rigid inputs?","text":"<p>Reply: For determining whether an input has to be considered as elastic or rigid the rules are set out under point 4 of the GHG methodology. Rigid inputs include all inputs qualifying as a carbon source for the production of recycled carbon fuels, as well as outputs produced in fixed ratio by an incorporated process, which represent less than 10% of the economic value of the output. All other inputs are to be considered as elastic. Hence, the categorisation of an input may depend on the circumstances. Rigid inputs would therefore comprise liquid or solid waste streams of non-renewable origin which are not suitable for material recovery or waste processing gas and exhaust gas of non-renewable origin which are produced as an unavoidable and unintentional consequence of the production process in industrial installations (taken from the definition of RCF). Waste heat from processes might also fall into that category. Elastic inputs comprise for instance petroleum products, electricity, natural gas and CO<sub>2</sub>. In case of doubt an input should be considered as elastic.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q46","title":"46.

Point 1 of the Annex of the GHG methodology can be considered to set out allocation rules for emissions in its own right.

This represents a specific rule for a production step yielding only energy products including RFNBOs and RCF while point 15 sets out general rules including mixes of energy products and other products. The rules set out in point 15 therefore apply on top of the specific rule set out in point 1. If for instance a process yields next to RFNBOs, RCF and other fuels also materials with no energy content, a first allocation should be done based the economic value of the co-products as set out under point 15(f), while for the energy products the allocation rule set out under Point 1 applies.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q48","title":"48.

For RFNBO H2 as an intermediate for conventional transport fuel production: What fraction from RFNBO H2 input to the refinery can fulfil RFNBO mandate?","text":"<p>Reply: Article 25(2) of the revised RED allows the counting of renewable fuels of non-biological origin that are used as intermediate products for the production of conventional transport fuels and biofuels. This means that all renewable hydrogen that is used for the production of conventional transport fuels in oil refineries can be counted towards the objectives of Article 25(1), i.e. before the final fuel is consumed. This implies that the contribution is counted towards the RES-T target in the Member State where the renewable fuel is used in the production of the fuel and not where the final fuel is consumed i.e. conventional fuels produced in the refinery will continue to count as fossil fuels. Under the revised RED also H2 as an intermediate that is used for the production of biofuels can be counted towards the targets set out in transport.

One way to transport renewable hydrogen over long distance is to ship it in the form of derivatives (e.g. ammonia, methanol or methane) and to reconvert it into renewable hydrogen at the place of consumption.

Where the use of heat for reconversion of derivatives does not increase the heating value of the products, the share of RCF and RFNBO is not affected. To establish whether electricity and heat that are used in a process are adding to the heating value of the fuel, the heating value of the derivative that enters the process and qualifies as an RFNBO should be compared to the heating value of the hydrogen the process yields. If the heating value of the hydrogen that yields from the process exceeds the heating value of the RFNBO input, the heating value is increased and accordingly the electricity and heat is adding to the heating value of the fuel and must be considered as relevant energy.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#Q58","title":"58.

In case of partial vessel loading or storage, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the RFNBO should be attributed according to the share of RFNBOs in the mixture.

For determining the share of RFNBO in total output, only the relevant energy input matters as set out under point 2 of the GHG methodology. For determining the GHG emission intensity all electricity input is considered. Electricity that is fully renewable is considered as having an emission intensity of 0 gCO2eq/MJ, while partially renewable electricity usually has a higher GHG emission intensity.

This can be considered to cover all cases where the electricity is adding to the heating value of the fuel or where electricity is used to power equipment that is required for the production or further processing of RFNBOs. Electricity used for the production of materials with no energy content or inputs that do not qualify as RFNBOs cannot be considered as fully renewable.
