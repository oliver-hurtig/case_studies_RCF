This annex aims to provide inform on how the relevant provisions set out in the RED and the GHG methodology should be implemented to derive the share of RFNBOs in the output of the process as well as the achieved emission savings. Articles 25(2)(a) and 30 (2) of RED as well as Point 1 of the Annex to the GHG methodology are in particularly relevant for the implementation.</p> <p>Articles 25(2)(a) RED sets out that renewable fuels of non-biological origin are counted towards the targets if they are used as intermediate products for the production of conventional transport fuels and biofuels. This covers cases where renewable hydrogen is used in refineries e.g., to remove impurities during the hydro treating a well as hydrogen used for the production of HVO and methanol that is use for the production of biodiesel . Given that the hydrogen is already counted, such use of hydrogen is not further considered for the calculation of the share of renewable energy in the output of the process.</p> <p>The GHG methodology sets out a specific rule for calculating the emission intensity of RFNBOs stemming from a process where co-processing is applied. It allows to distinguish in the calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions intensity on a proportional basis of the energetic value of inputs between: (1) the part of the process that is based on the conventional input and (2) the part of the process that is based on renewable fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels assuming that the process parts are otherwise identical.</p> <p>If for instance a process uses H<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub> as well as other energy inputs to produce synthetic fuels and the producer intends to replace 20% of the H2 with H2 qualifying as RFNBO, it would be possible to determine the emission intensity of the produced synthetic fuels assuming a virtual process which uses only 20% of all inputs mentioned above (20% of each input). In this example, all hydrogen qualifying as RFNBO (which is 20% of the total H<sub>2</sub> input) would be used in the virtual process, and the other 80% of the hydrogen (all non-RFNBO) would be used in the other process which uses 80% of all inputs. Such process would also yield only 20% of the output, but only the energy share of RFNBO hydrogen in the input would be considered an RFNBO. It would be possible to replace in this virtual process more than one input. Not only RFNBOs but also RCF, biomass, renewable electricity, renewable heat and CO<sub>2</sub> (including biogenic) could be used for this purpose. While the use of RCF and biomass would not add to the share of RFNBOs in the output, they could reduce the emission intensity of the output as the entire output of the virtual process would have the same emission intensity.</p> <p>\\(S_{RFNBO,out} = \\frac{E_{RFNBO,in}}{E_{educts}}\\) (1)</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>\\(S_{RFNBO,out}\\): energy share of the product that can be counted as RFNBO</p> <p>\\(E_{RFNBO,in}\\): energy content of the RFNBO input only</p> <p>\\(E_{educts}\\): energy content of all \u201crelevant\u201d inputs (as defined in the DA).</p> <p>For instance, as stated above, if 20% of the energy of the \"relevant\u201d inputs comes from hydrogen that qualifies as renewable, 20% of the output can be claimed as RFNBO.</p> <p>For the share calculated above, it is possible to virtually split the process and determine the emissions for the RFNBO only as follows:</p> <p>\\(Em_{RFNBO} = \\sum_{\\, n}^{\\,}s_{n} \\cdot e_{i,n} + e_{p} + e_{td} + e_{u} - e_{ccs}\\) (2)</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>n: each \u201crelevant\u201d input</p> <p>s<sub>n</sub>: energy share of the input \u201cn\u201d: \\(s_{n} = \\frac{E_{n,in}}{E_{educts}}\\)</p> <p>e<sub>i,n</sub>: emissions intensity for the supply of the input \u201cn\u201d.</p> <p>Inputs qualifying as RFNBO can be attributed to this part of the virtually split process with the upper limit of the energy (or stoichiometric) ratio of the input entering into the output (meaning the energetic share of all inputs has to be respected also for the virtually split part).</p> <p>CO2 emissions from fuel combustion have to be counted in the term e<sub>u</sub>. If non-fossil carbon enters into the molecule of the output, those emissions might be compensated by the e<sub>ex use</sub> included in e<sub>i</sub> for those non-fossil inputs. The share of RFNBOs in the output of the virtual process would be determined as set out under point 3 of the Annex to the GHG methodology. If the process yields more than one output, each type of output would include the same share of RFNBOs, RCF and other fuels in line with Article 30(2) of the RED[^8]. The ratio of different outputs of the virtual process should not differ from the share of outputs of the whole process. In accordance with point 1 of the GHG methodology it is possible to determine the emission intensity of the output over a period of at most one calendar month. </p> <p>Example of a process with several inputs</p> <p>Outputs</p>"},{"location":"faq/#criteria-effective-carbon-pricing-system","title":"Criteria effective carbon pricing system","text":"<p>The GHG Methodology sets out that emissions from the existing use or fate of an input can be deducted from the calculation of the emission intensity of RFNBOs and RCF.
