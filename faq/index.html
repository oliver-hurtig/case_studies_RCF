<p>Reply: ...xxx...
 No. While point 1 of the Annex of the GHG methodology sets out that in case of the production of mix of fuels (RFNBOs RCF and other fuels), all (fuel) types shall be considered to have the same emission intensity, emission intensity, Delegated Regulation 2023/1185 applies only for defining the emission intensity of RFNBOs and RCF. Hence this rule serves only the purpose of allocating the appropriate share of emissions to RCF and RFNBOs. The correct methodology to determine the emission intensity of biofuels for the purposes set out in Article 29 RED is set out in Article 31 of the Directive and the related Annexes.</p>
<h1 id="annex">Annex</h1>
<h2 id="implementation-of-bidding-zone-concept-and-curtailment-in-third-countries">Implementation of bidding zone concept and curtailment in third countries</h2>
<p>The RFNBO delegated act refers to several concepts set out in the EU electricity market design legislation. This concerns in particular the following two matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept of the bidding zone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rules on curtailment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The methodology requires to implement the rules in third countries based on equivalent concepts.</p>
<p><u>Implementation of the concept of bidding zone</u></p>
<p>As regards the implementation of the bidding zone concept the recitals of the GHG methodology provide some guidance:</p>
<p>Recital 3: “[…]<em>Where reference is made to bidding zone and imbalance settlement period, concepts that exist in the Union but not in all other countries, it is appropriate to allow fuel producers in third countries to rely on equivalent concepts provided the objective of this Regulation is maintained and the provision is implemented based on the most similar concept existing in the third country concerned. In case of bidding zones such concept could be similar market regulations, the physical characteristics of the electricity grid, notably the level of interconnection or as a last resort the country</em>”<em>.</em></p>
<p>Accordingly, the following approach should be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Certifiers should assess whether at the location of the electrolyser, market regulations applied are similar to the rules set out for bidding zones in Regulation (EU) 2019/943. In this context “similar” means that there are rules requiring establishing hourly prices for electricity in a geographical area. If such rules are in place, the geographical area for which the prices are established should be considered as a bidding zone for the purpose of the implementation of the methodology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If such rules are not in place, certifiers should assess whether the electricity network in the country of production is integrated or whether there are several separated networks. If there are several networks, each network should be considered as a bidding zone for the purpose of the implementation of the methodology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the electricity network of the country is integrated and there are no geographically differentiated electricity prices, the whole country may be considered as one bidding zone for the purpose of the implementation of the RFNBO delegated act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the methodology requires certain conditions to be met related to the concept of a bidding zone e.g., on the average proportion of renewable electricity (Article 4(1)), the emission intensity of electricity (Article 4(2)) or the price of electricity (Articles 6 and 7(1)), the conditions can only be considered as fulfilled if compliance can be demonstrated based on reliable data from official sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Implementation of rules on curtailment</u></p>
<p>The methodology in Article 4(3) of the RFNBO delegated act sets out that electricity taken from the grid may be counted as fully renewable during an imbalance settlement period during which the fuel producer can demonstrate, based on evidence from the national transmission system operator, that a) power-generating installations using renewable energy sources were redispatched downwards in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and b) the electricity consumed for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuel of non-biological origin reduced the need for redispatching by a corresponding amount. RFNBOs producers will likely rely on these rules only in exceptional cases and a misuse of the provision can only be avoided by following the rules thoroughly. An implementation of this provision in third countries will therefore only be feasible if it set out entities adopting the tasks of national transmission system operators as well as rules for redispatching.</p>
<h2 id="_1"></h2>
<h2 id="implementation-of-the-rules-on-co-processing-of-rfnbos">Implementation of the rules on co-processing of RFNBOs</h2>
<p>RFNBOs may be produced in processes which rely, next to renewable hydrogen, also on other inputs including fossil fuels, recycled carbon fuels and biomass. This annex aims to provide inform on how the relevant provisions set out in the RED and the GHG methodology should be implemented to derive the share of RFNBOs in the output of the process as well as the achieved emission savings. Articles 25(2)(a) and 30 (2) of RED as well as Point 1 of the Annex to the GHG methodology are in particularly relevant for the implementation.</p>
<p>Articles 25(2)(a) RED sets out that renewable fuels of non-biological origin are counted towards the targets if they are used as intermediate products for the production of conventional transport fuels and biofuels. This covers cases where renewable hydrogen is used in refineries e.g., to remove impurities during the hydro treating a well as hydrogen used for the production of HVO and methanol that is use for the production of biodiesel . Given that the hydrogen is already counted, such use of hydrogen is not further considered for the calculation of the share of renewable energy in the output of the process.</p>
<p>The GHG methodology sets out a specific rule for calculating the emission intensity of RFNBOs stemming from a process where co-processing is applied. It allows to distinguish in the calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions intensity on a proportional basis of the energetic value of inputs between: (1) the part of the process that is based on the conventional input and (2) the part of the process that is based on renewable fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels assuming that the process parts are otherwise identical.</p>
<p>If for instance a process uses H<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub> as well as other energy inputs to produce synthetic fuels and the producer intends to replace 20% of the H2 with H2 qualifying as RFNBO, it would be possible to determine the emission intensity of the produced synthetic fuels assuming a virtual process which uses only 20% of all inputs mentioned above (20% of each input). In this example, all hydrogen qualifying as RFNBO (which is 20% of the total H<sub>2</sub> input) would be used in the virtual process, and the other 80% of the hydrogen (all non-RFNBO) would be used in the other process which uses 80% of all inputs. Such process would also yield only 20% of the output, but only the energy share of RFNBO hydrogen in the input would be considered an RFNBO. It would be possible to replace in this virtual process more than one input. Not only RFNBOs but also RCF, biomass, renewable electricity, renewable heat and CO<sub>2</sub> (including biogenic) could be used for this purpose. While the use of RCF and biomass would not add to the share of RFNBOs in the output, they could reduce the emission intensity of the output as the entire output of the virtual process would have the same emission intensity.</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(S_{RFNBO,out} = \frac{E_{RFNBO,in}}{E_{educts}}\)</span> (1)</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(S_{RFNBO,out}\)</span>: energy share of the product that can be counted as RFNBO</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(E_{RFNBO,in}\)</span>: energy content of the RFNBO input only</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(E_{educts}\)</span>: energy content of all “relevant” inputs (as defined in the DA).</p>
<p>For instance, as stated above, if 20% of the energy of the "relevant” inputs comes from hydrogen that qualifies as renewable, 20% of the output can be claimed as RFNBO.</p>
<p>For the share calculated above, it is possible to virtually split the process and determine the emissions for the RFNBO only as follows:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(Em_{RFNBO} = \sum_{\, n}^{\,}s_{n} \cdot e_{i,n} + e_{p} + e_{td} + e_{u} - e_{ccs}\)</span> (2)</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>n: each “relevant” input</p>
<p>s<sub>n</sub>: energy share of the input “n”: <span class="arithmatex">\(s_{n} = \frac{E_{n,in}}{E_{educts}}\)</span></p>
<p>e<sub>i,n</sub>: emissions intensity for the supply of the input “n”.</p>
<p>Inputs qualifying as RFNBO can be attributed to this part of the virtually split process with the upper limit of the energy (or stoichiometric) ratio of the input entering into the output (meaning the energetic share of all inputs has to be respected also for the virtually split part).</p>
<p>CO2 emissions from fuel combustion have to be counted in the term e<sub>u</sub>. If non-fossil carbon enters into the molecule of the output, those emissions might be compensated by the e<sub>ex use</sub> included in e<sub>i</sub> for those non-fossil inputs. The share of RFNBOs in the output of the virtual process would be determined as set out under point 3 of the Annex to the GHG methodology. If the process yields more than one output, each type of output would include the same share of RFNBOs, RCF and other fuels in line with Article 30(2) of the RED[^8]. The ratio of different outputs of the virtual process should not differ from the share of outputs of the whole process. In accordance with point 1 of the GHG methodology it is possible to determine the emission intensity of the output over a period of at most one calendar month.<strong><br />

<h2 id="criteria-effective-carbon-pricing-system">Criteria effective carbon pricing system</h2>
<p>The GHG Methodology sets out that emissions from the existing use or fate of an input can be deducted from the calculation of the emission intensity of RFNBOs and RCF. Such emissions may include the CO2 equivalent of the carbon incorporated in the chemical composition of an RFNBO or and RCF including cases where CO2 was captured and incorporated into the fuel provided certain conditions have been met. One condition applying for considering CO2 that has been captured from an activity listed under Annex I of Directive 2003/87/EC is that it has been taken into account upstream in an effective carbon pricing system.</p>
<p>To be considered as an effective carbon pricing system a number of criteria have to be met. This includes  a number of minimum criteria ensuring the enforcement of the measure as well as design features ensuring the establishment of a carbon price that ensures a reduction of emissions.</p>
<p>The minimum criteria comprise all of the following : The system must</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>have a robust MRV (each tonne emitted is paid for);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be binding on its participants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be stable; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>impose the carbon price at least on the whole sector;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure stringent enforcement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure that the carbon price established by the system can lead to emission reductions, it must have the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the country or region has committed to achieving carbon neutrality and established an ETS with a declining cap or a carbon tax with an increasing trajectory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the systems do not include design features that render them ineffective such as an overuse of off-sets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following countries and regions can be considered to fulfil the requirements for an effective carbon pricing system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EU MS as well as countries apply the EU ETS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>….</p>
